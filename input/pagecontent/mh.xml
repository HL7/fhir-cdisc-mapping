    Medical history could include information from a wide range of FHIR resources.  However, the most typical resources are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}adverseevent.html">AdverseEvent</a> - These would be filtered to only extract issues that would not qualify as 'adverse events', but were still potentially study-relevant (perhaps having occurred prior to the study).</li>
    <li><a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}allergyintolerance.html">AllergyIntolerance</a> - captures both the propensity to reaction as well as specific reaction occurrences</li>
    <li><a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}condition.html">Condition</a> - used to capture healthcare problems as well as other conditions (e.g. pregnancy)</li>
    <li><a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html">Observation</a> - captures symptoms, assessments, non-study pertinent lab results (e.g. blood type), etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mappings are provided for all of these.
