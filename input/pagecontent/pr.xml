	  Procedures, in FHIR, use the <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}procedure.html">Procedure</a> resource.  However, like Observations, the notion of Procedure is quite broad.  It includes counseling, education and physio-therapy as well as more traditional concepts such as surgery.  One area of interest relevant to CDISC mapping that has not yet been decided in the FHIR standard is how best to handle the ordering and adminsistration of non-drug therapies that involve the notion of 'dose' - for example radiation, light therapy, etc.  Options being considered include expanding the scope of the Medication resources, adding dose elements or extensions to Procedure, or defining a separate set of resources.  Because this area is not yet settled, no mappings are provided for the dose-relevant elements.

  <p>
    In some cases, procedure information may be captured only in document form (as <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}documentreference.html">DocumentReferences</a>) or as the associated <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}encounter.html">Encounter</a>.  Because of the limited metadata available in these, no mappings are provided.
