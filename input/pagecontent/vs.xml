    Like laboratory results, vital signs are also typically captured in <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation.html">Observations</a>.  FHIR actually defines <a href="{{site.data.fhir.path}}observation-vitalsigns.html">specific profiles</a> for common vital sign measures, significantly increasing the consistency of basic vital signs data.  These profiles mandate the declaration of the <code>vital-signs</code> category.  This allows vital signs to be easily separated from other observations.

    One consideration to be aware of is that Blood Pressure is typically captured as a single Observation with two components, however it is sometimes captured as two distinct resource instances.  When converting, both approaches will need to be accounted for.
