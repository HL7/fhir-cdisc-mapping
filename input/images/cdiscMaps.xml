         <comment>In FHIR, an medication can be categorized in multiple ways and to the granularity  desired.  When converting from FHIR to CDASH, systems will need to look at the FHIR categories (and potentially other information) to determine how best to populate CMCAT and CMSCAT based on the study-designed categories (unless they've pre-arranged with the EHR to ensure it captures the same codes)</comment>
