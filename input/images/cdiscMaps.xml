Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosomal and other gender aspects.

If there's a need to convey alternate gender codes, then those would appear either as Observation values or as extension values on Patient (the former for clinical information, the latter for administrative purposes).

Observation links to Patient. If the patients are the same, that establishes the linkage.

         <comment>Product Relatedness implies that the product is involved in the AE, but it doesn't indicate overdose.   After looking through other fields, it does not look like there is a field that would cover this situation.   In studies, OD  would be a reason why the AE was marked as an SAE.</comment>

            <br/>The path using the extension will only exist if the system maintaining the AdverseEvent/Condition/AllergyIntolerance/Observation is aware of its relevance to the Study.   ResearchStudy links to Patient. Observation links to Patient. If the patients are the same, that establishes the linkage. There's also an extension that allows direct linkage to a 'study' from any resource - if the source system has actually established such a linkage.</comment>

            <br/>The path using the extension will only exist if the system maintaining the MedicationStatement/Request/Dispense/Administration or Immunization is aware of its relevance to the Study.    ResearchStudy links to Patient. Observation links to Patient. If the patients are the same, that establishes the linkage. There's also an extension that allows direct linkage to a 'study' from any resource - if the source system has actually established such a linkage.</comment>

         <comment>FHIR doesn't have 2 distinct category levels. The option exists to have as many categorizations with whatever axes and granularities needed or desired.  When mapping data to a particular study, it would be necessary to decide what category values best correspond to CAT vs. SCAT.  A standard extension will be needed to convey multiple repetitions in R4.  (Procedure.category does repeat in the draft of R5) The SNOMED binding is an example, which means that any codes can be used. Even if the binding were stronger, alternate codes would be possible on other repetitions.</comment>

Coding translations are left to the sponsor.<br/>
            <br/>Status of 'not-done', 'entered-in-error' would indicate that it didn't happen, 'active', 'in-progress', 'on-hold', 'completed' would indicate that it did.  'stopped' would indicate that it started, but was abnormally terminated - where that should go depends on the study's definition of 'occur'.</comment>

         <gap>Sex and gender are multi-faceted.concepts. Both FHIR and CDISC standards have a large degree of ambiguity in their definitions for their primary data elements describing a subject’s sex or gender (DM.SEX and Patient.gender).  This ambiguity often exists in original source systems. Depending on the use case, the Various facets of sex and gender may be utilized or captured within clinical data..  - physiologic, social, chromosomal, etc.  As such, it's not advisable to indicate a mapping where all the facets of sex and gender are ambiguous in both the source and study data standards.  Study sponsors and regulators will need to establish policies and look into the quality and nature of the source data as well as the analysis that needs to be performed to determine appropriate mappings. <br/>
            <br/>Extensions such as US core "birth sex" and FHIR core "gender identity" may give more semanticly consistent values, but may not be widely populated   Some gender concepts such as physiologic and genetic characteristics may be captured as Observation values rather than as demographics elements on Patient</gap>
